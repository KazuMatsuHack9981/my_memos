css, js, imagefile into one file.

## files generated by rails new

### bin/webpack
command which compiles such files as js, css, ....  
This is nearly same as `rake assets:precompile`.

### bin/webpack-dev-server
This will detect changes in files and automatically render to the browser.

### config/webpacker.yml
For controlling webpack in Rails. Most importantly, setting entrypoint  
which will be the base point for loading js files from browser.
